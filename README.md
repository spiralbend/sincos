Fun triggy visualizations on an HTML5 canvas, and a 3D version made with THREE.js

0-9 and the qwerty row of keys change the object being modeled. Backspace randomizes the elements. ESC to pause. SPACE to reverse.

These are screen hacks in the tradition of XScreenSaver and are not intended have any actual research value. I just think they look cool and are fun to look at.

Based on the principle of smooth transition via gradual, incremental changes to parameters.

That's it; enjoy!
